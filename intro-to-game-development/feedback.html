        <h1>Suggestions for giving feedback</h1>
        <p>
          
          <ul>
             <li> Play the game! </li>

            <li> Describe your experience 
              <ul>
                <li> Describe what you did, what you thought while you were doing it, and what you were trying to do. </li>
                <li> Avoid making judgments or suggestions at this point, the creator can come to their own conclusions based on their design goals. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li> Start by mentioning something you liked! 
              <ul>
                <li> Remember that sharing work can be a vulnerable experience : ) </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              Wait to make for suggestions until the creator asks for them, or first ask: "Is it okay for me to make a suggestion".
            </li>

            <li> Consider asking first: </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Is there anything specific you are looking for feedback on?</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li> It's very possible that the person you're giving feedback for is looking for something specific, or that they didn't have time to get to something.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

        <h1>Suggestions for receiving feedback</h1>
        <p>
          
          <ul>            
            <li> Watch and listen
              <ul>
                <li> You will likely get the best information by simply watching someone play your game without your help. </li>
                <li> Exception: If your game is not yet in a place where someone can play without guidance, it's okay to help the player get to the part that you want feedback about. Just remember that someday you won't be there. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li> Ask them to describe their experience (see previous section)
              <ul>
                <li> You already saw what they did, but it might be helpful to uncover what they were thinking while they were doing it. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              Ask for specific feedback as it relates to a specific aspect of your game or in connection to one of your specific design goals.
            </li>  

            <li>
              Give content warnings
              <ul> 
                <li> If your game deals with sensitive subjects, let your player know beforehand. Allow your playtester to decline playing for this reason if needed </li>
              </ul>
            </li>          
          <ul>

        <h1>Core takeaways</h1>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Feedback resulting from playtesting can often be contradictory. Different people will want different things.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prioritize what you watch people do, over what they say. People often have trouble giving negative feedback, and/or difficulty with putting their feedback into words, but if someone gets stuck while they're playing...
            </li>
            <li>
              Your job as a designer is to take these contradictions and incorporate them back into your work to provide the experience you want to achieve. You can't do it all!
            </li>
