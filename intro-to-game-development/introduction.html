      <div class="slide">
        <h1>Who I am not:</h1>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li> I haven't worked on a game at a large game company. </li>

        <h1>My take on what a game design class should include:</h1>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li> Students should play and discuss games as part of class. </li> 
            <li> Students should develop skills that can be applied to game development regardless of current in-vogue technologies. </li>
            <li> I should present non-dominant narratives about games, with a focus on equity and accessibility. <i> You can get dominant narratives about games anywhere! </i> </li>
            <li> I should provide professional perspectives for a variety of student goals such as:
              <ul>
                <li> wanting to work at a large game company </li>
                <li> wanting to freelance or start your own game studio </li>
                <li> interest in entering the fine art world </li>
                <li> and anything else related to "games" that students let me know about! </li>
              </ul> 
            </li>
            <li> I should provide some insight into how to avoid being exploited within the industry. </li>
          <ul>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="slide">
        <h1>A final thought on this class:</h1>
        <p>
          We aren't going to spend much time defining what a "game" is.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think it is more useful to ask ourselves: <b>"Why do I want to call this specific thing I'm making <i>a game</i>?"</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          You're the creator! You can call what you do whatever you want, we should just start thinking about the effect that calling it a "game" or "art" or an "experience" will have on how an audience perceives it.
