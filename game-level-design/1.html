              <ul>
                <li> 
                  Inspired (I'm assuming) by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictionary">Pictionary</a> by Robert Angel (1981).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Take 2 or 3 minutes on your own to see if you can figure out how to play, then I will start a private room.

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Questions to consider during play:
              <ul>
                <li>Is this game accessible?</li>
                <li>What are the rules of this game?</li>
                <li>How does this game teach you the rules?</li>
                <li>What is the goal of this game?</li>
                <li>How is the goal supported (or not) by the rules?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

        <h1>Let's try to play a game by ourselves!</h1>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li> A card game! </li>
            <li> If you don't own a deck of cards, you can use a browser-based deck at <a target="_blank" href="https://playingcards.io/game/standard-deck">playingcards.io</a>. Note, you might want to try this out either way because it is an option for your assignment.</li>
            <li> Pick <a target="_blank" href="https://bicyclecards.com/rules/?results=show#filter=.solitaire">one of these singleplayer (a.k.a "solitaire") games</a> that you don't know how to play, and try to play it. (This page doesn't work perfectly and might take a moment to load more games).</li>

        <h1> Your assignment: </h1>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li> Create rules for a game that can be played remotely without any equipment (except for a pen and paper, those are allowed), or that can be played using <a target="_blank" href="https://playingcards.io/game/standard-deck">playingcards.io</a>. 
              <ul>
                <li> You are going to give these rules to some of your classmates next class for them to play. You will be present to watch your classmates play, but the goal is to allow them to play your game without your help using only the rules you've provided. </li>
                <li> It can be a singleplayer or multiplayer game, but please limit your game to a maximum of 4 players. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

              Take in this 19 minute video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWQcuBigOj0">How Accessible Were This Year's Games?</a> by Game Maker's Toolkit (2020)
              <ul>
                <li> Consider: How accessible are the rules you are creating? What kind of challenges might people run into when playing? </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Bring a pen and paper to class next time in case one of your classmates needs you to use it for their game.
