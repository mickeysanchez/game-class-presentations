            <li> What is accessibility? </li>
            <li> Class, race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, physical/cognitive ability and more... more here </li>

            financial accessibility: how much does your game cost? what kind of equipment do you need to access it?
            race/ethnicity: what language is your game available in?
            race/ethnicity, gender, and sexuality: what kind of representation is in your game? what kind of content warnings might you include to be sensitive to trauma?
            physical/cognitive: how well versed in game playing do your players need to be? what kind of physical/cognitive faculties do your players need to enjoy the game comfortably? 

            <li> What does the player need to have access in order to play and enjoy your game </li>

            <!-- <li> Describe your experience 
              <ul>
                <li> Describe what you did, what you thought while you were doing it, and what you were trying to do. </li>
                <li> Avoid making judgments or suggestions at this point, the creator can come to their own conclusions based on their design goals. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li> Start by mentioning something you liked! 
              <ul>
                <li> Remember that sharing work can be a vulnerable experience : ) </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              Wait to make for suggestions until the creator asks for them, or first ask: "Is it okay for me to make a suggestion".
            </li>

            <li> Consider asking first: </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Is there anything specific you are looking for feedback on?</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li> It's very possible that the person you're giving feedback for is looking for something specific, or that they didn't have time to get to something.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
