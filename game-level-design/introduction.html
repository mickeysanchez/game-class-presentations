        <h1> Some slightly less "official" info about me: </h1>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li> I live in Southeast Portland. </li>

      <div class="slide">
        <h1>Who I am not:</h1>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li> I haven't worked on a game at a large game company. </li> 
            <li> I am not an expert in 2D or 3D visual art and asset creation. </li>
            <li> I haven't taught a semester long class before! </li>
          <ul>
        </p>

      <div class="slide">
        <h1>My take on what a game design class should include:</h1>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li> Students should play and discuss games as part of class. </li> 
            <li> Students should develop skills that can be applied to game development regardless of current in-vogue technologies. </li>
            <li> I should present non-dominant narratives about games, with a focus on equity and accessibility. <i> You can get dominant narratives about games anywhere! </i> </li>
            <li> I should provide professional perspectives for a variety of student goals such as:
              <ul>
                <li> wanting to work at a large game company </li>
                <li> wanting to freelance or start your own game studio </li>
                <li> interest in entering the art world </li>
                <li> and anything else related to "games" that students let me know about! </li>
              </ul> 
            </li>
            <li> I should provide some insight into how to avoid being exploited within the industry. </li>
          <ul>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="slide">
        <h1>A final thought on this class:</h1>
        <p>
          We aren't going to spend any time defining what a "game" is.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think it is more useful to ask ourselves: <b>"Why do I want to call this specific thing I'm making <i>a game</i>?"</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          You're the creator! You can call what you do whatever you want. Of course, calling it a "game" or "art" or an "experience" will each have a different effect on how others perceive it...
        </p>
        <p>
          And since this class is called <i>Game Level Design</i> we're mostly going to be talking about what happens when you call your work a "game". (But we'll also spend a little time talking about what happens when you frame it as "art").
